  <h1>How to Negotiate Medical Bills — Down to Almost Nothing</h1>
  <p class="lede">The number on the bill is not what you have to pay. Hospitals charge insurance companies 3–5x what they'll accept from an uninsured patient who asks. Here's how to ask.</p>
</div>
<div class="content">

<div class="callout">
  <div class="callout-label">💰 The core fact</div>
  <p style="margin:0">Hospitals have a "chargemaster" rate (the full bill) and a "cash rate" that's typically <strong>40–80% less</strong>. Nonprofit hospitals are legally required to have financial assistance programs. This is federal law. They don't advertise it.</p>
</div>

<h2>Step 1: Request an itemized bill</h2>
<p>Call billing and say: <em>"I'd like an itemized bill with CPT codes for every charge."</em></p>
<p>The CPT codes let you look up what each procedure actually costs. Medical billing errors are common — studies find errors in <strong>80% of medical bills</strong>. Catching one error can remove hundreds or thousands.</p>
<p>Look up any CPT code at: <a href="https://npidb.org">npidb.org</a> or Healthcare Bluebook.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Ask for the uninsured/cash rate</h2>

<div class="script">
<span class="speaker">YOU:</span> "I'm paying out of pocket. What is your cash rate for this bill?"
</div>

<p>This single question often drops the bill 30–60% immediately. Hospitals negotiate this constantly with insurance companies — they'll do it with you too.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Apply for financial assistance</h2>
<p>Every nonprofit hospital (most major hospitals are nonprofit) must offer financial assistance under the ACA. Ask specifically:</p>

<div class="script">
<span class="speaker">YOU:</span> "Do you have a financial assistance or charity care program? Can you send me the application?"
</div>

<p>Income thresholds are often <strong>up to 400% of the federal poverty level</strong> — around $60,000 for a single person in 2024. If you qualify, the bill can be reduced to zero or near-zero.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Make a settlement offer</h2>
<p>After asking for financial assistance and the cash rate, make an offer:</p>

<div class="script">
<span class="speaker">YOU:</span> "I can pay [30–50% of the bill] as a one-time payment today if you can accept that as payment in full. Would that work?"
</div>

<p>Billing departments have authority to accept settlements. A payment today is worth more to them than chasing full payment for months. They will often say yes.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Set up a payment plan if needed</h2>
<p>If you can't pay anything upfront, ask for a payment plan. Most hospitals will accept <span class="money">$25–$50/month</span>. A bill in a payment plan <strong>cannot be sent to collections</strong> as long as you're paying.</p>

<div class="callout">
  <div class="callout-label">✅ Know this</div>
  <p style="margin:0">Medical debt under $500 was removed from credit reports in 2023. Medical debt paid off can be removed from reports within 12 months. And medical debt, even on your report, matters less to most lenders than other types of debt.</p>
</div>

<h2>Free help</h2>
<p><strong>Dollar For</strong> (<a href="https://dollarfor.org">dollarfor.org</a>) — nonprofit that applies for hospital financial assistance on your behalf. Free. They've gotten millions in bills eliminated.</p>
<p><strong>NeedyMeds</strong> (<a href="https://needymeds.org">needymeds.org</a>) — database of patient assistance programs by drug and hospital.</p>
<p><strong>CFPB complaints</strong> — if a hospital is violating ACA financial assistance requirements, file at <a href="https://consumerfinance.gov/complaint">consumerfinance.gov/complaint</a>.</p>
