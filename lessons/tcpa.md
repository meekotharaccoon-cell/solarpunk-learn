# TCPA: Robocalls Are Illegal and You Can Sue

**What it is:** The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (47 U.S.C. § 227)

**What it does:** Makes it illegal to call or text your cell phone using an autodialer or prerecorded message without your written consent.

**What you get if they break it:** $500–$1,500 per call. Statutory — you don't have to prove you were harmed. The violation IS the harm.

---

## The Key Facts

- **Each call is a separate violation.** Got 12 calls from the same scammer? That's potentially $18,000.
- **Texts count too.** Same rules, same damages.
- **Being on the Do Not Call Registry helps** but is not required. Even if you're not registered, robocalls to your cell are illegal without consent.
- **"Consent" must be in writing.** Verbal consent isn't enough under the TCPA.
- **You can revoke consent any time** — say "remove me from your list" and document it.

## How to Document a Violation

1. **Note the date, time, and number** that called you
2. **Screenshot or record** any voicemail
3. **Write down what they said** as soon as the call ends
4. **Check your phone bill** — carriers keep call records you can request
5. **Record future calls** (one-party consent recording is legal in most states — check yours)

## What to Do

### Option 1: Use the TCPA generator

The [SolarPunk Legal TCPA generator](https://github.com/meekotharaccoon-cell/solarpunk-legal/blob/main/tools/tcpa_generator.py) creates a demand letter in 2 minutes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meekotharaccoon-cell/solarpunk-legal
python solarpunk-legal/tools/tcpa_generator.py
```

Answer the prompts. Get a ready-to-mail demand letter.

### Option 2: File directly with regulators (free, takes 5 minutes)

- **FCC complaint:** consumercomplaints.fcc.gov
- **FTC complaint:** ftc.gov/complaint
- **Your state AG:** search "[state] attorney general complaint"

Regulatory complaints don't get you money but they create a record that helps when you or others sue.

### Option 3: Small claims court

- No lawyer required
- Filing fee: $30–75
- Most companies settle before the court date once they receive the summons
- The summons arriving is often enough

### Option 4: TCPA attorney (free to you)

Many TCPA attorneys work on **contingency** — they take a percentage of the settlement and you pay nothing upfront. Good for high-volume violators (many calls, large companies).

Search: "TCPA attorney" + your city, or use the National Consumer Law Center (nclc.org).

## Common Questions

**"I gave them my number on a form, doesn't that mean I consented?"**
Not necessarily. Consent must be specific — it has to say you're agreeing to receive automated calls. A general "contact me" checkbox often doesn't qualify. And you can revoke it any time.

**"The company is overseas, can I still sue?"**
Yes. If they're calling US numbers they're subject to US law. You sue where you live.

**"What if it's a local business I know?"**
Same law applies. Live calls from a real person are generally fine. Autodialed or prerecorded calls without consent are not, regardless of who's making them.

**"They said 'press 2 to be removed' — does that count?"**
If you press it and they call again, that's a new violation. Document the removal request.
