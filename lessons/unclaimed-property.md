# Unclaimed Property: Billions of Dollars Waiting to Be Claimed

**What it is:** When a financial account goes inactive — forgotten bank accounts, uncashed checks, insurance payouts, utility deposits, stock dividends — the company is required by law to turn the money over to the state. The state holds it indefinitely. It's yours whenever you claim it.

**How much:** Over $70 billion in unclaimed property in US states. Billions more claimed every year.

**Cost to claim:** Free. Always free. Anyone who charges you to claim your own money is a scammer.

## Scams to Avoid

- Anyone charging a percentage to "help you claim" — the state gives it to you for free
- "Unclaimed funds locators" — legal but unnecessary, they take 10-40% of your own money
- Any site that isn't the official state portal or missingmoney.com
