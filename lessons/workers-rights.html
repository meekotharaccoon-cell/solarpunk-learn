  <h1>Workers Rights Most Employers Don't Tell You About</h1>
  <p class="lede">Federal law gives workers significant protections. Most employers don't volunteer this information. Here are the ones that matter most — and what to do when they're violated.</p>
</div>
<div class="content">

<div class="right">
  <div class="right-title">You can discuss your salary with coworkers</div>
  <p style="margin:0;font-size:.9rem;color:rgba(255,255,255,0.5)">The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) protects "concerted activity" — which includes talking about pay. Policies that prohibit salary discussion are <strong>illegal</strong> for most private sector workers. This right exists even if you're not in a union.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
  <div class="right-title">Tip pooling has strict rules</div>
  <p style="margin:0;font-size:.9rem;color:rgba(255,255,255,0.5)">Employers and managers <strong>cannot take a share of tip pools</strong>. Tips belong to workers. Violations: file with the Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division — <a href="https://dol.gov/agencies/whd">dol.gov/agencies/whd</a>. Recovery includes back tips + equal amount in damages.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
  <div class="right-title">Misclassification as a contractor is often illegal</div>
  <p style="margin:0;font-size:.9rem;color:rgba(255,255,255,0.5)">If you're treated like an employee (set hours, specific tools required, single employer), you may legally <em>be</em> an employee regardless of what your contract says. Misclassified workers can recover unpaid overtime, benefits, and employer-side taxes. File with the IRS (Form SS-8) or state labor board.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
  <div class="right-title">Unpaid wage recovery has no upfront cost</div>
  <p style="margin:0;font-size:.9rem;color:rgba(255,255,255,0.5)">Wage theft attorneys work on contingency — you pay nothing unless you win. Under the FLSA, employers pay attorney fees if you win. This means free legal representation for unpaid overtime, minimum wage violations, and off-the-clock work claims.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
  <div class="right-title">FMLA gives you 12 weeks of job-protected leave</div>
  <p style="margin:0;font-size:.9rem;color:rgba(255,255,255,0.5)">If you've worked for an employer with 50+ employees for 12 months and 1,250 hours, you're entitled to 12 weeks of <strong>unpaid, job-protected leave</strong> per year for serious health conditions, family care, or birth/adoption. They cannot fire you for taking it.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
  <div class="right-title">Retaliation for complaints is illegal</div>
  <p style="margin:0;font-size:.9rem;color:rgba(255,255,255,0.5)">OSHA, FLSA, NLRA, and most other labor laws have anti-retaliation provisions. If you file a complaint and are fired, demoted, or otherwise punished, that's a <strong>separate violation</strong> often worth more than the original claim. Document everything before you file.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
  <div class="right-title">Non-competes are often unenforceable</div>
  <p style="margin:0;font-size:.9rem;color:rgba(255,255,255,0.5)">The FTC ruled in 2024 to ban most non-competes. Even before that ruling, non-competes for low-wage workers were unenforceable in many states (CA, ND, OK, MN ban them entirely). Talk to an employment attorney before assuming you're bound. Initial consultations are often free.</p>
</div>

<h2>Where to file</h2>
<p><strong>Wage theft / overtime / misclassification:</strong> Department of Labor — <a href="https://dol.gov/agencies/whd">dol.gov/agencies/whd</a></p>
<p><strong>Workplace safety:</strong> OSHA — <a href="https://osha.gov/workers">osha.gov/workers</a></p>
<p><strong>Discrimination:</strong> EEOC — <a href="https://eeoc.gov">eeoc.gov</a></p>
<p><strong>Union organizing / NLRA violations:</strong> NLRB — <a href="https://nlrb.gov">nlrb.gov</a></p>
<p>All free to file. All have retaliation protections.</p>

<div class="callout">
  <div class="callout-label">✅ The documentation rule</div>
  <p style="margin:0">Before you do anything: document. Screenshot pay stubs. Save emails. Write down dates, times, what was said, who was present. Evidence wins cases. Memories are insufficient.</p>
